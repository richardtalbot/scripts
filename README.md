Hello. This folders contains the following useful scripts:

cleandisk.sh -- cleans the apt cache, tmp, and ext journal, then launches cleansnaps. May be useful for cleaning a Debian/Ubuntu docker image or system with low disk space.
cleansnaps.sh -- cleans up older versions of snaps, only most recent version of each snap retained. For Ubuntu.
CompactFolders.bat -- compacts several system folders to reduce space. First we set the compact flag on the folders (but not subfolders), then we compact all files with xpress16k. For Windows 10+.
mysqlbackup.sh -- a very simple backup script that creates a 7 day rotation of gzipped backups of your mysql/mariadb database folder. Just schedule it with cron nightly (or once weekly to have a 7 week rotation). Should work with most linux distros.
